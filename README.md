Problem:
When enough houses can generate their own energy, it becomes possible that
excess energy will be generated. It's economically beneficial to be able to
store that excess energy into batteries for later use, however it is
economically beneficial as well to place and select batteries as strategically
as possible to minimize battery and cable costs. What exactly is the most
economic set-up can result into an astronomically large range of battery and
cable layouts. Thus this program is made to return the most beneficial layout
according to our set of priorities.
